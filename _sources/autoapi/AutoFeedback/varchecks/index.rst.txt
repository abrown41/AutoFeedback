.. py:function:: check_value(a, b)

   
   check that variable a has the same value as b

   Note that this has been tested for strings, integers, floats, numpy arrays,
   lists, tuples and sympy objects. In the case of sympy objects, the
   expressions are simplified to make sure that they are compared correctly,
   so that x*x == x**2 for instance.
